# DSA-C

A collection of classic Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in C.

This repository contains simple, readable implementations intended for learning and practice.

**Contents**

- `Graphs/` — Graph algorithms and representations.
- `Linked List/` — Singly and doubly linked list implementations and examples.
- `Queue/` — Queue implementations and demonstrations.
- `Searching&Hashing/` — Searching algorithms and basic hashing examples.
- `Sorting/` — Sorting algorithm implementations (quick, merge, heap, etc.).
- `Stack/` — Stack implementations and examples (`ArrayStack.c`, `LinkedStack.c`, `PostFix.c`).
- `Trees/` — Binary trees and related algorithms.

**Quick start**

Requirements:
- A C compiler (GCC/Clang) installed and available on PATH.

Compile a single example (from repository root):

```powershell
gcc "Stack/ArrayStack.c" -o ArrayStack.exe
./ArrayStack.exe
```

Or compile multiple files together, for example:

```powershell
gcc "Linked List/*.c" -o linked_examples.exe
./linked_examples.exe
```

Notes:
- File and folder names contain spaces and `&` — wrap paths in quotes when using the shell.
- These programs are educational; feel free to read and modify the source.


Happy learning!
